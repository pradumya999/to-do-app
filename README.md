# to-do-app

A simple and lightweight **To-Do App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Add new tasks** instantly  
- **Mark tasks as complete** with a single click  
- **Edit existing tasks** in place  
- **Delete tasks** you no longer need  
- **Dynamic rendering** — updates happen instantly without reloading the page  
- **Keyboard support** — press `Enter` to quickly add or save edits  

## How It Works

The app dynamically updates the DOM using JavaScript:
- Tasks are stored in an in-memory array.  
- Each task can be edited, completed, or removed individually.  
- Completion state and edits update the display immediately.
